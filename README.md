# SmartFarming 
Our projects enables farmers to gain real-time insights on soil, crops, and weather, enabling smarter decisions to optimize water use, reduce waste, and boost yields. Data-driven agriculture is revolutionizing farming with satellite data, sensors, and AI. This innovation promotes sustainability, helping tackle global challenges like food security and climate change while enhancing efficiency.

In this challenge, we developed an intuitive mobile app to help farmers make smarter, data-driven decisions. Farmers can select their location and vegetation type, and the app uses satellite data and machine learning to provide actionable insights. It also integrates real-time IoT data to create a digital twin, offering a comprehensive view of farm conditions to optimize resource use and boost productivity.
